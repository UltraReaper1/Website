            Vincent Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853 in the Netherlands. Van Gogh had a rough early life, as his family struggled financially. Van Gogh would eventually work at a firm of art dealers. He was rejected by someone who he had affection for, and this changed him because he decided to devote his life to god. He would however paint more than 2,100 works, but he would eventually take his own life, and he did not recieve any fame while he was living.
